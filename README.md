# Data-Analysis-Sales-Project
I am currently working on several exciting projects in Python that deals with the field of deep data analysis. Here I will perform an in-depth analysis of electronics sales. Using Pandas, I will clean, transform and visualize data to get a clear understanding of sales trends.

The first step of the project is to prepare the data using Pandas. I will clean the data to remove missing values and outliers, and transform it to be consistent and easily actionable. Next, I'm going to use Pandas to create interactive charts and dashboards to visualize sales trends. I will also look for relationships between electronics sales and other external factors such as seasonal events.

I really enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to hone my Python and Pandas skills while working on a real-world project.
